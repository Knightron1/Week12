# Week12

1. Write your explanation in the README.md file of your weekly repo.

2. For each task you will create a .js file to write the code examples with comments provided for each line of code.

3. An executable code files MUST be provided.

4. For each explanation in your README.md file you write you MUST provide pseudocode and diagrams.

5. For each task you will explain in your own words.

6. You can research and use any suitable resources you need to complete this activity. Make sure you reference your resources using APA style in the README.md.

1. Write an introduction of JavaScript Data Structure stores Hash Tables & Dictionaries and explain each one of them. (Provide with your explanation pseudocodes, diagrams and executable code)


Hash Tables

Hash Table is a data structure which stores data in an associative manner. In a hash table, data is stored in an array format, where each data value has its own unique index value. Access of data becomes very fast if we know the index of the desired data.

Thus, it becomes a data structure in which insertion and search operations are very fast irrespective of the size of the data. Hash Table uses an array as a storage medium and uses hash technique to generate an index where an element is to be inserted or is to be located from.

Dictionaries

The Dictionary object is used to store information in name/value pairs (referred to as key and item). The Dictionary object might seem similar to Arrays, however, the Dictionary object is a more desirable solution to manipulate related data.

Comparing Dictionaries and Arrays:

    Keys are used to identify the items in a Dictionary object
    You do not have to call ReDim to change the size of the Dictionary object
    When deleting an item from a Dictionary, the remaining items will automatically shift up
    Dictionaries cannot be multidimensional, Arrays can
    Dictionaries have more built-in functions than Arrays
    Dictionaries work better than arrays on accessing random elements frequently
    Dictionaries work better than arrays on locating items by their content
